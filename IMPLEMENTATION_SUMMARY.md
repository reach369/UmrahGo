   - Implemented service dependency checks
   - Added webhook notifications for deployment status

4. **Security and Performance**
   - Used non-root user in Docker containers
   - Added resource limits
   - Improved file permissions
   - Implemented proper process management with tini

## Docker Configuration Enhancement

Docker setup has been improved for better performance and reliability:

1. **Optimized Dockerfile**
   - Updated to Node.js 20
   - Added health check support
   - Improved caching and layer optimizations
   - Added build arguments for environment variables

2. **Enhanced docker-compose.yml**

## Health Check API

Created a comprehensive health check API:

```typescript
// src/app/api/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  // Returns health status including:
  // - Application status
  // - Memory usage
  // - CPU load
  // - Uptime
  // - Environment information
}
```

This health check is used by:
- Docker containers for auto-healing
- GitHub Actions for deployment verification
- External monitoring systems
- Load balancers for service discovery
